# Advent of Code

My entries for AdventOfCode.com, written in PureScript.

## Thoughts

### 2017, Day 2

Used a real parser today! Nice excuse to use Control.Fold too. I wish I'd
figured out how to solve this one in O(n) time. :-/

### 2017, Day 1

Fun. An easy start. I wish the spec had been clearer though.

### Warm Up - 2016, Day 1

I need to get familiar with PureScript parsing libraries. Arguably
using a real parser is overkill for the task, but why am I doing this
if not to learn? :-D
