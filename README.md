# Advent of Code

My entries for AdventOfCode.com, written in PureScript.

/Disclaimer: I'm not claiming that this code is beautiful, or even
100% correct, just that it earns me those precious, precious
stars. :-D/

## Thoughts

### 2017, Day 6

This seemed like an easy one that just had a lot of legwork.

I have clearly gotten over my phobia of Data.Tuple.Nested, as I'm
using `/\` syntax everywhere now. :-)

### 2017, Day 5

Not hard, but hard to get performant. Part 2 really falls apart if
your implementation isn't quick enough.

### 2017, Day 4

Easy. I'm willfully over-using `Fold` here for the fun of it.

### 2017, Day 3

The hardest so far. I got the algorithm really quickly, but getting it
right took me ages. I'm very gad this challenge happened on a weekend.

### 2017, Day 2

Used a real parser today! Nice excuse to use Control.Fold too. I wish I'd
figured out how to solve this one in O(n) time. :-/

### 2017, Day 1

Fun. An easy start. I wish the spec had been clearer though.

### Warm Up - 2016, Day 1

I need to get familiar with PureScript parsing libraries. Arguably
using a real parser is overkill for the task, but why am I doing this
if not to learn? :-D
